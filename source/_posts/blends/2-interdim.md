## I followed a tutorial!
Like...
A WHOLE tutorial, the whole of 9 mins. Can recommend, actually having a result instead of frustration is nice.
For the record, it was [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WENCKOPrwVs). 

## ...also i have a YT channel now to post videos
You can watch [✨the finished thing in action✨](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eQg_zLTyvA) on my new fancy shmancy youtube channel! 
(I know, no one likes YT, i'm already thinking about alternatives)
It's rotating. It contains different things. It's doing stuff. Yay.




Until then, have a screenshot:
