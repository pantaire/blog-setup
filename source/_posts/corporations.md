excerpt: Part 1 of what may become a short film

Since I no longer have a gametime subscription of everyone's favorite MMO, the ideas for short films came back. So, because everything else seemed to be too scary to start with, I started with designing a few logos for random corporations of this short film universe. 

All of them aim to look like they could be used in our world. And so far, I'm okay with the results. 
Some of those names are inspired by or partially taken from the [Fantasy Name Generator](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/company-names.php), which is really great for all kinds of names. 

## Skycom

SkyCom is the mainstreams' communication platform, run by a guy who claims he became a billionaire through hard work (and seems to forget to mention his massive inheritance). 
## Lambda Corp

Lambda really could go anywhere, but it gives off strong insurance vibes. Maybe even some security niche.   
## Ridge Sec

I feel like RidgeSec will play a major role in the film, if it will ever be finished before my motivation runs out. But this is no place for potential spoilers, RidgeSec does all the patrolling around the city in search of the bad guys. 
They also decide who the bad guys are for themselves, sometimes. 
## MediaWave

MediaWave is your basic We Do Something With Social Media Corporation, that no one really knows where they get their money from. Fitting for this world, if you ask me.  
## Orco

Orco reminds me of Target, though I only know this place from the internet. It's a big supermarket chain with stores all around the relevant part of the film universe. 
## Dynacast

I really have no idea what Dynacast could stand for. Please don't ask me. Maybe Streaming? I just liked the name.
The love of my life suggested something like clay molds, so this is what I roll with now.
