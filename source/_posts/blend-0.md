## I made a Temple.
This was the day I used my first curve to model something. It's the small hand rail. Just sayin. 
I'm not quite sure where to go with this - the initial plan was to model wayyy more details, but this is more timeconsuming than I anticipated. 
So...
here you go. May this spark joy.
