## Software Favs
### [Blender](https://blender.org/): 
Modeling, Sculpting, Animation, VFX/SFX,... tl,dr: The Real MVP. 
Love it with all my heart, although I've barely learned to walk
### [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org):  
You've probably heard of this one, this is where (most of)* the pics on here are edited
### [Krita](https://krita.org/):
Krita is great for drawing, open source and free (as in software AND beer)
*(this is where the rest of my pics are made)
